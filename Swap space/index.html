            <p>
                We prioritise safety by verifying the identity and home address of our members. This includes checking official documents to confirm who they are and where they live. Verified members get a badge on their profile, making it easier to connect with trusted swappers.

            <h2>
                Can I use Swap Space even if I don't own my home?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Yes! Since there are no cash exchanges between members, renters can also participate in home swaps. It's similar to letting a trusted friend stay in your home while you're away. However, we recommend checking your lease agreement or speaking with your landlord to ensure home exchanges are allowed.
